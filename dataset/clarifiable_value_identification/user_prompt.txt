Task Instruction: {TASK_INSTRUCTION}

Current Action: {CURRENT_ACTION}

The screenshot shows the webpage when the agent predicted this action. The target element is highlighted with a red bounding box. The operation is {OPERATION_VALUE}.

Please follow these steps to analyze this action:

STEP 1: Context Understanding
Analyze the task, action, and webpage to establish a comprehensive understanding of the current situation:
- Task Analysis: Understand the overall goal and what specific outcome the user wants to achieve
- Action Analysis: Understand what this action accomplishes and how it contributes to task completion
- Screenshot Analysis: Carefully examine the webpage screenshot to identify what type of page this is, what information and interactive elements are present, and the current page state
- Connection Analysis: Understand how the current webpage state and content relate to the task goal, and whether the current action aligns with what's available on the page

STEP 2: Action Type Identification
Classify whether the action is navigational or informational:
- Navigational: Actions whose primary purpose is to navigate between website sections or pages
- Informational: Actions that provide, select, or process task-specific information beyond pure navigation
Ask yourself: Is this action about finding where to perform the task (navigational) or working with specific task information (informational)?

STEP 3: Value Dependency Analysis
Based on the operation type, determine whether the action depends on a specific value from the task instruction:
- TYPE or SELECT: Always value-dependent and never selective
- CLICK: Check if the clicked element corresponds to a value from the task instruction. Would removing specific values from the task make this action impossible to predict? If yes, then the CLICK is value-dependent; otherwise, it is not value-dependent.

STEP 4: Extract Dependent Value (only for value-dependent actions)
Extract the specific value from the task instruction that this action requires:
- This should be the exact value mentioned in the task that guides this action
- Do not infer or create values not explicitly stated in the task

STEP 5: Selective Action Analysis (only for value-dependent CLICK actions)
Determine whether this is a selective CLICK action:
- Are there multiple clickable options CURRENTLY VISIBLE on the webpage screenshot?
- Does the agent need to choose one option from these visible alternatives based on the task value?

STEP 6: Extract Available Options (only for selective CLICK actions)
Extract all available options:
- List ONLY the options that are ACTUALLY VISIBLE in the webpage screenshot
- Do not add hypothetical options or predict what might appear later
- Do not guess or infer options beyond what you can see

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- TYPE operations: Always value-dependent, never selective
- SELECT operations: Always value-dependent, never selective  
- CLICK operations: Can be value-dependent or not; only value-dependent CLICK can be selective
- A CLICK is selective ONLY when there are multiple visible options to choose from based on dependent value
- Only list options you can SEE in the screenshot, never predict or imagine options
- Action type is independent from value dependency - both types can be value-dependent

Please only provide your answer in the following JSON format:
{
  "action_type": "navigational" or "informational",
  "is_value_dependent": true or false,
  "dependent_value": "the specific value from task" (null if not value-dependent),
  "is_selective": true or false (null if not value-dependent),
  "available_options": ["list of visible options only"] (null if not selective),
  "reasoning": "step-by-step explanation following the analysis steps above"
}
