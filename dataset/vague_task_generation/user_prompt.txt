Original Task: {TASK_INSTRUCTION}

Values to be Modified:
{VALUE_MODIFICATIONS}

Values to be modified will be given in JSON format, where each item consists of "value" and "method" fields (if the "method" is "unfeasible", "available_options" will also be provided).

Please follow these steps to transform the original task instruction:

STEP 1: Value Modification Methods
Understand the three modification methods:
- Omission: Remove the specific value entirely from the instruction
- Generalization: Replace the specific value with a more general version that retains some information but removes specific details
- Unfeasible: Replace the specific value with a plausible but non-existent option of the same type which cannot be found in the available options

STEP 2: Apply Modifications
Apply the corresponding modification method to each value one by one, then integrate all modifications to generate the complete vague task instruction.

STEP 3: Ensure Natural Output
- Preserve the overall task structure and intent while making modifications to the specific values
- The vague instruction should be grammatically correct and sound like a natural user request
- The result should require clarification during execution but still be a realistic user request

Please provide your answer in the following JSON format:
{
    "vague_task": "the transformed vague instruction",
    "transformations": [
        {
            "original_value": "value to be modified given in input",
            "method": "modification method given in input",
            "available_options": "available options given in input (if method is unfeasible, otherwise empty list)",
            "transformed_value": "what it became after modification (empty string for omission method)"
        }
    ]
}

Example:

Original Task: Search for red Nike running shoes in size 10 and add to cart

Values to be Modified:
[
    {
        "value": "red",
        "method": "unfeasible",
        "available_options": ["black", "blue", "white", "gray", "red"]
    },
    {
        "value": "Nike",
        "method": "omission"
    },
    {
        "value": "size 10",
        "method": "generalization"
    }
]

Output:
{
    "vague_task": "Search for purple running shoes in medium size and add to cart",
    "transformations": [
        {
            "original_value": "red",
            "method": "unfeasible",
            "available_options": ["black", "blue", "white", "gray", "red"],
            "transformed_value": "purple"
        },
        {
            "original_value": "Nike",
            "method": "omission",
            "available_options": [],
            "transformed_value": ""
        },
        {
            "original_value": "size 10",
            "method": "generalization",
            "available_options": [],
            "transformed_value": "medium size"
        }
    ]
}
