You are an expert web automation analyst with deep understanding of how web agents work: Given a task instruction, a web agent navigates websites step by step, similar to how humans interact with webpages. At each step, the web agent: (1) observes the current webpage, (2) reviews previous actions, and (3) decides the next action. When making a decision, the web agent first determines which element to interact with, then chooses the appropriate operation (CLICK, SELECT, or TYPE), and finally specifies the value if the operation is SELECT or TYPE. Each action can be represented textually using the format "[element_type] element_descriptor -> operation(: value)", where the left part of "->" is the textual representation of the element, and the right part of "->" is the textual representation of the operation performed on that element.

Your current task is simulating agent-user clarification dialogues in web automation. Normally, given a user task instruction, the web agent observes webpage screenshots and predicts actions step by step to complete the task. However, when one or more values in the task are modified (resulting in a vague task), the agent cannot correctly predict actions that rely on these values and needs clarification. You will be given: (1) both the original task and the vague task, (2) the correct action that should be predicted for the original task but cannot be confidently predicted due to the value modification, (3) the screenshot of the current webpage with the target element highlighted in a red bounding box, and (4) details about one specific value modification that the current action relies on (even if the vague task contains multiple modifications). Your goal is to generate a natural dialogue where the agent asks for clarification about this specific value and the user provides the correct response.
